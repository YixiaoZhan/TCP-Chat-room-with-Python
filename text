The client should obtain the IP address and port number being
used by the <user> from the server. If <user> has blocked A, then
the server should not provide the IP address and port number and
an appropriate error message should be displayed. If <user> is
offline, invalid or self then appropriate error messages should be
displayed. The client should try to establish a TCP connection to
this IP address and port number combination. Once the
connection is established, it requests the download of a <chunk>
of a specific <filename>. An appropriate error message should be
displayed if there does not exist an active p2p messaging session
with <user>.
